Magic Item: Hellrider’s Badge - Klysandral’s Champion
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by someone designated by Duke Ulder Ravengard)
A Hellrider’s Badge is only usable by a member of the Hellriders, and thanks to your efforts during Klysandral’s funeral and the subsequent escape from Avernus you have been awarded honorary membership by Duke Ulder Ravengard himself. This badge marks you as a lieutenant in the Hellriders.
While wearing the badge, you gain a +2 bonus to AC if you aren’t using a shield.
If the badge is more than 5 feet away from you for more than one minute, it vanishes and harmlessly reappears on a surface within 5 feet of Duke Ravengard. While holding the badge, the Duke know your location, provided the two of you are on the same plane of existence and your attunement to the badge hasn’t ended.
As an action, the Duke can touch the badge and end your attunement to it, as he has been granted this power by Elturel despite not being a Hellrider himself.
