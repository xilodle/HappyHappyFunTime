Tortles believe that night and day watch over them and other creatures. The moon is the eye of night that
watches over them in darkness, and the sun is the equally vigilant eye of the day. Tortles feel most at peace when one or both of these eyes are looking down on them. They become more nervous and uneasy when neither orb is visible to them.
Blessed are the days when both the sun and the moon are visible in the sky at the same time.
